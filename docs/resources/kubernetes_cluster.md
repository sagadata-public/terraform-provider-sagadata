# sagadata_kubernetes_cluster (Resource)

Kubernetes cluster resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a private network for the Kubernetes cluster
resource "sagadata_private_network" "cluster_network" {
  name    = "k8s-network"
  region  = "NORD-NO-KRS-1"
  cidr_v4 = "10.1.0.0/24"
}

# Create a Kubernetes cluster with a private network
resource "sagadata_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name    = "my-k8s-cluster"
  network = sagadata_private_network.cluster_network.id
}

# Access cluster credentials via the data source
data "sagadata_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  id = sagadata_kubernetes_cluster.example.id
}

# Output the kubeconfig (mark as sensitive)
output "kubeconfig" {
  value     = data.sagadata_kubernetes_cluster.example.kubeconfig
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The human-readable name for the Kubernetes cluster.
  - If the value of this attribute changes, the resource will be replaced.

### Optional

- `network` (String) The network ID for the cluster (private network ID).
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when this Kubernetes cluster was created in RFC 3339.
- `id` (String) The unique ID of the Kubernetes cluster.
- `status` (String) The Kubernetes cluster status.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp when this Kubernetes cluster was last updated in RFC 3339.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import sagadata_kubernetes_cluster.example my-k8s-cluster
```
