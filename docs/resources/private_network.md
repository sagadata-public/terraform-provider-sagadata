Private network resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a private network with IPv4 CIDR
resource "sagadata_private_network" "example" {
  name        = "my-private-network"
  description = "Private network for my infrastructure"
  region      = "NORD-NO-KRS-1"
  cidr_v4     = "10.0.0.0/24"
}

# Create a private network with IPv6 CIDR
resource "sagadata_private_network" "ipv6_network" {
  name        = "ipv6-network"
  description = "IPv6-only private network"
  region      = "NORD-NO-KRS-1"
  cidr_v6     = "fd00::/64"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The human-readable name for the private network.
- `region` (String) The region identifier.
  - If the value of this attribute changes, the resource will be replaced.
  - The value must be one of: ["EUC-DE-MUC-1" "EUW-GB-MNC-1" "EUW-NL-AMS-1" "NA-CA-FTS-1" "NA-CA-MNZ-1" "NA-CA-PRG-1" "NORD-NO-KRS-1"].

### Optional

- `cidr_v4` (String) The IPv4 CIDR block for the private network.
  - If the value of this attribute is configured and changes, Terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.
- `cidr_v6` (String) The IPv6 CIDR block for the private network.
  - If the value of this attribute is configured and changes, Terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.
- `description` (String) The human-readable description for the private network.
  - Sets the default value "" if the attribute is not set.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when this private network was created in RFC 3339.
- `id` (String) The unique ID of the private network.
- `status` (String) The private network status.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp when this private network was last updated in RFC 3339.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
